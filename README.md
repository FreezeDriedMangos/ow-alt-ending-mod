# Outer Wilds - Uncertain Futures

This mod adds additional content and an additional main-story ending.

The nature of this ending is meant to be discovered, exactly like the regular Outer Wilds gameplay. To begin this content, you must own and have beaten the DLC, Echoes of the Eye.

Once you have done so, there's a strange new signal your signalscope has started detecting. I wonder what it is...
