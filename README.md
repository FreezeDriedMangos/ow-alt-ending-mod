# Outer Wilds Additional Ending

This mod adds additional content and an additional main-story ending.

The nature of this ending is meant to be discovered, exactly like the regular Outer Wilds gameplay. To begin this content, you must own and have beaten the DLC, Echoes of the Eye.

Once you have done so, return to the setting of Echoes of the Eye, there's an additional object for you to find. I wonder what you can do with it...?
